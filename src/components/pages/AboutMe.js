        Hi there! 
        <br></br>
        <br></br> 
        My name is Steve, and I am a (soon to be) certified full-stack developer. 
        <br></br>
        <br></br> 
        I have a varied background, a bachelor's degree in psychology, and nearly a decade's worth of experience managing teams and projects in imaging operations for financial institutions. My passion however, lies in working with technology and coding. 
        <br></br>
        <br></br> 
        Please take a look at my work, and feel free to contact me if you're looking for a developer with good communication skills, a growth mindset, and a strong work ethic!
      </p>
